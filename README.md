# Electricity-Price-Analysis
## Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of electricity sales, prices, and customer metrics across sectors and regions in the United States. As energy demand continues to rise, understanding market dynamics is vital for businesses and stakeholders. This project aims to uncover trends, seasonal effects, and sector-specific insights that support informed decision-making and strategic planning.

The project consists of two main components:
1. **Data Analysis**: A comprehensive exploration and analysis of electricity metrics using Python.
2. **Power BI Dashboard**: An interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes key metrics, allowing users to explore findings in a dynamic and accessible way.

## Objectives

- Analyze trends in electricity sales and revenue over time.
- Examine how electricity prices and revenue vary by state and sector.
- Investigate seasonal impacts on electricity pricing and revenue.
- Identify which sectors contribute the most to overall electricity sales.
- Explore customer distribution across various states.

## Dataset

The analysis uses the **US Electricity Sales** dataset from Kaggle, which contains information on:

- Sales
- Revenue
- Prices
- Year
- Month
- Number of customers
- Sector
- Region

## Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning and Wrangling**: Prepare the dataset by handling missing values and removing redundant entries.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualize key metrics to identify patterns and trends in electricity usage, pricing, and revenue.
3. **Key Metrics Calculation**: Compute metrics such as Revenue Generated per Customer to provide further insights.
4. **Seasonal Analysis**: Investigate the effect of seasons on electricity consumption and revenue.

## Power BI Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard has been created to visualize the core metrics and trends uncovered in the analysis. This dashboard provides a dynamic summary of the data, including:

- Regional and sector-based comparisons of electricity prices, revenue, and customer counts.
- Seasonal fluctuations in electricity demand and pricing.
- Sector contributions to total electricity sales.

The dashboard enhances the project's accessibility by allowing users to interactively explore and understand the findings.

## Visualizations

The project includes various visualizations that depict trends in electricity sales, revenue, and pricing across different sectors and regions. The Power BI dashboard further illustrates these findings, making them more actionable for stakeholders.
